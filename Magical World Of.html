Metal as we know it today was started through Black Sabbath, evolved when the early wave of British Heavy Metal bands such as Iron Maiden and Judas Priest came into the mainstream and different variations consisting of different sounds has developed thorugh the years. These range from a vast array of "sub-genres" from thrash metal, death metal, power metal, glam metal, industrial metal to the new wave of American metal and more. </p>
